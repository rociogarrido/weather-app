# Weather App

A simple weather app in React JS, using the Open Weather Map API to make calls to a restful api and return the current weather data. This uses the Modern Javascript Fetch API along with React hooks and conditionals.

## How I worked on this project 👩🏼‍💻

🚀 My goal was to continue practicing React by building a Weather App.

# Features

- The application fetches data from the<a href="https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather/"> openweathermap </a>.
- Dynamic background image according to weather condition for selected city.

## How to use it?

- Just enter your city in the input box.</p>
